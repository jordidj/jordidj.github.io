Welcome to my personal page! My name is Jordi and I am currently working as a research fellow in theoretical plasma physics in the Solar and Magnetospheric Theory Group at the University of St Andrews (UK). Here, the main focus of my work is on oscillations and instabilities of magnetohydrodynamic equilibria and the process of 3D magnetic reconnection.

During my PhD at KU Leuven (Belgium), I developed a wide range of interests and skills.
* My first venture into plasma physics consisted of the analysis of the ideal, warm, two-fluid ion-electron dispersion relation. This revealed an intricate web of crossings and avoided crossings between the six wave types in the frequency-wavenumber diagram, which led to a theoretical investigation of oblique whistler waves. Current efforts are focused on the extension of the results to a collisional plasma.
* I am one of the co-developers of the open-source, spectroscopic MHD code [Legolas](https://legolas.science). For any Cartesian or cylindrical, one-dimensionally varying magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium, the code quantifies the natural oscillations and instabilities for any selection of non-ideal effects. Current efforts are focused on connecting Legolas to the non-linear simulation code [MPI-AMRVAC](https://amrvac.org).
* In the latter half of my PhD, I developed an interest in magnetic reconnection. This led to a parametric investigation of the influence of flow on the resistive tearing instability using the Legolas code.
* As the parameter space in my parametric investigations grew, I became increasingly interested in ways of automated classification of (Legolas) data. Consequently, I set up a collaboration to label Legolas data with the use of neural networks.

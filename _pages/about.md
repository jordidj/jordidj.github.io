Working as an FWO junior postdoctoral researcher in theoretical (space) plasma physics at the Centre for mathematical Plasma Astrophysics at KU Leuven (Belgium), the main focus of my work is on the application of spectroscopic methods for magnetohydrodynamic and multifluid plasma models to the process of magnetic reconnection.

Main research interests:
* **Multifluid plasma descriptions.** In an ideal, two-fluid ion-electron plasma, my work revealed an intricate web of crossings and avoided crossings between the six wave types in the frequency-wavenumber diagram, which led to a theoretical investigation of oblique whistler waves. In our most recent work on the topic, these results were extended to a collisional plasma.
* **Magnetohydrodynamic spectroscopy with the [Legolas](https://legolas.science) code.** For any Cartesian or cylindrical, one-dimensionally varying magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium, this code quantifies the natural oscillations and instabilities for any selection of non-ideal effects. A multifluid version of the code is in development, funded by the [Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be).
* **Magnetic reconnection.** Recently, I have studied the influence of flow on the resistive tearing instability using the Legolas code, and the competition and interaction between tearing and thermal instability in coronal current sheets.
* **Transition between linear and non-linear regimes.** Using a Python-based framework, Legolas's linear solutions can be directly inserted in non-linear simulations with [MPI-AMRVAC](https://amrvac.org). This allows a closer look at the transition between linear and non-linear regimes, and offers more control over non-linear mode interaction.
* **Machine learning.** As the parameter space in my parametric investigations with Legolas grew, I became increasingly interested in ways of automated classification of data. This led to a collaboration to label Legolas data with the use of neural networks.

If any of these topics piqued your interest, please check out my publications or reach out to me.

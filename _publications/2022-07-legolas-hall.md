__Abstract.__ Many linear stability aspects in plasmas are heavily influenced by non-ideal effects beyond the basic ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) description. Here, the extension of the modern open-source MHD spectroscopy code Legolas with viscosity and the Hall current is highlighted and benchmarked on a stringent set of historic and recent findings. The viscosity extension is demonstrated in a cylindrical set-up featuring Taylorâ€“Couette flow and in a viscoresistive plasma slab with a tearing mode. For the Hall extension, we show how the full eigenmode spectrum relates to the analytic dispersion relation in an infinite homogeneous medium. We quantify the Hall term influence on the resistive tearing mode in a Harris current sheet, including the effect of compressibility, which is absent in earlier studies. Furthermore, we illustrate how Legolas mimics the incompressible limit easily to compare with literature results. Going beyond published findings, we emphasise the importance of computing the full eigenmode spectrum, and how elements of the spectrum are modified by compressibility. These extensions allow for future stability studies with Legolas that are relevant to ongoing dynamo experiments, protoplanetary disks or magnetic reconnection.

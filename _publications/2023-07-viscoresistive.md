__Abstract.__ The MHD spectroscopic Legolas code is applied to a viscoresistive Harris current sheet for varying values of resistivity and viscosity, with and without the presence of shear flow. It is shown that whether the background flow has a stabilising or destabilising effect on the tearing instability depends on the specific combination of resistivity and viscosity.

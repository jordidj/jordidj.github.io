__Abstract.__ As an application of the general, warm two-fluid description, we consider a laser exciting a perpendicularly magnetised ion-electron plasma. In this setup, the laser can couple to the plasma's M mode to emit Cherenkov radiation. We show that this emission is restricted to a forward cone, whose angle $$\theta$$ is limited by the electron thermal velocity $$v_e$$ as $$\theta = \arccos v_e/c$$, where $$c$$ denotes the light speed.

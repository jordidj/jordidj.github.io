__Abstract.__ Many events in the solar corona depend heavily on the fundamental process of magnetic reconnection, which is regularly triggered by a tearing instability in sheared magnetic topologies. However, the dynamics in the corona are also strongly tied to non-adiabatic processes: radiative energy losses, heating, and thermal conduction. Under coronal conditions, these processes lead to an unstable thermal continuum, and a competition between tearing and thermal instability develops in coronal current sheets. We investigate the evolution of such current sheets, both linearly using the [Legolas](https://legolas.science) code as well as non-linearly by initiating non-linear simulations with linear solutions in [MPI-AMRVAC](https://amrvac.org).

__Abstract.__ Despite its extremely high temperature, the Solar corona features many cooler structures, like prominences and coronal rain. The root cause of the formation of cool and dense plasma is a thermal runaway effect, in which the plasma density increases in response to a decrease in temperature due to radiative cooling, in turn enhancing the radiative cooling effect again. This thermal instability can be triggered when a combination of radiative cooling, heating, and thermal conduction modifies the stable entropy mode into an unstable thermal continuum of highly localised modes. Performing a linear stability analysis, we show how the thermal continuum arises in a stratified atmosphere and 1D coronal loops, as well as how it is replaced with a quasi-continuum in a resistive medium and interacts with tearing instabilities in a current sheet. For the latter configuration, we simulate how the coupled tearing-thermal evolution behaves non-linearly.

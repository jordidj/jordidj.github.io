Lightning talk at the yt Workshop 2025, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

__Abstract.__ Thanks to the [MPI-AMRVAC](https://amrvac.org) frontend, we use *yt* to analyse magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the solar atmosphere. In this talk, we demonstrate the use of *yt* in a simulation of a solar coronal current sheet, which is susceptible to both tearing and thermal instability. With a combination of several *yt* functionalities, like slice plots and time series analysis, we obtain a full picture of the simulation's behaviour.

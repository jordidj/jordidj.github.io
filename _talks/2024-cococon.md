__Abstract.__ When non-linear simulations start from an equilibrium configuration, it is common practice to add an arbitrary perturbation at the initial time to kick off the evolution. Generally, it is argued that the exact form of the perturbation does not matter because the non-linear evolution mixes all linear eigenoscillations. To verify this claim, we use the [Legolas](https://legolas.science) code, which computes the linear eigenmodes of a given one-dimensionally varying equilibrium, to compute the natural oscillations of a Harris current sheet equilibrium and use several linear solutions and superpositions thereof as initial perturbations in [MPI-AMRVAC](https://amrvac.org). The resulting non-linear time evolutions are analysed and compared to identify both similarities and differences, and whether, and how, the initial perturbation influences further evolution.

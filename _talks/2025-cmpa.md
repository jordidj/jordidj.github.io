Seminar at the Centre for mathematical Plasma Astrophysics, KU Leuven, Belgium.

__Abstract.__ Both the [Legolas](https://legolas.science) code and [MPI-AMRVAC](https://amrvac.org) allow us to study the dynamics of magnetohydrodynamic systems. However, they take fundamentally different approaches, where Legolas quantifies the natural oscillations and instabilities of a one-dimensionally varying state whilst MPI-AMRVAC provides a framework to simulate the (up to) 3D time evolution non-linearly. Together, these codes may offer a more complete picture of the dynamics than either code could on its own. Therefore, some of my recent efforts have focused on the development of GIMLI, the General Interface for MPI-AMRVAC / Legolas Interconnection, allowing for the initialisation of MPI-AMRVAC simulations with linear solutions obtained with Legolas, and vice versa, analysing MPI-AMRVAC simulation slices in Legolas. In this seminar, I will present some of the ways in which I (am trying to) use GIMLI, and what we have to gain from it.
